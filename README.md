### Standing United
When the Pandavas were exiled, they built a small hut in the forest by a river and started living there. One day, Duryodhan decided to visit the forest to mock the Pandavas and take pleasure in their suffering. He went there with a large army. At the time, a group of Gandharvas was bathing in the river, and Duryodhan picked a quarrel with them. A fight broke out, and although Duryodhan was brave, he was no match for the Gandharvas. They captured him and took him prisoner.

When Duryodhan’s soldiers ran to the Pandavas' hut and shouted for help, Bhim and Arjun were initially delighted to hear of Duryodhan’s plight. They felt he deserved it because of his wickedness. However, Yudhishthir, the eldest brother, reminded them of their duty. He said, “Duryodhan is still our brother. Within our family, we may have disputes, but when it comes to outsiders, we are not five or one hundred—we are one hundred and five. Go quickly and rescue him from the Gandharvas.”

Following Yudhishthir’s command, Bhim and Arjun went to battle the Gandharvas. They fought bravely, defeated them, and freed Duryodhan. However, Duryodhan’s pride remained intact. He did not express gratitude to the Pandavas and returned home without even thanking them.

### Akhandanand Swami's Nishchay
Akhandanand Swami (senior) was an ardent staunch devotee with extreme patience. Once he was passing through a forest with his disciples. They saw four tigers coming towards them. The disciples hurried to climb up the trees. Akhandanand Swami said, "The death is destined according to one’s own previous actions. It is sure to come. Nobody can escape from it. You may die by falling from the tree or even by stumbling. One should not fear from death. "

The disciples climbed up the tree. The tigers came nearer. One of them ran forward and lifted his paw to kill him. Almighty Bhagwan gave them the knowledge of the greatness of Swami. The tiger was standing with his paw lifted up. Akhandanand Swami remained steadfast in remembering Shriji Maharaj. Suddenly, as if answering a call from above, the ferocious animal dropped its paw. All the tigers prostrated, circumambulated and went away.

> #### Moral: ###
> Bhagwan will always save you, given you never lose faith in Him

### Bhaguji - Hajuri Parshad
Once, Khabad and Mataro (two mercenaries) arrived in Gadhada with two hundred men in order to fight for disputed land. Maharaj sent Bhaguji along with a band of forty other Parshads to the site. The two parties met and fought. Khabad threw a blow of the sword on Bhaguji’s right arm, which disabled it. But Bhaguji was resilient and fought gallantly with his left hand! He threw an immense blow and cut both Khabad and his horse, defeating them. But during the fight, Bhaguji was left with the scars of 18 cuts.

Bhaguji was left in a terrible state to recuperate. Maharaj himself saw to his recovery and served him dearly. Indeed he was at his deathbed but Maharaj saw to it and fully revitalised him.

Bhaguji was felicitated by the King of Bhavnagar and offered a very lucrative post in the state’s army, but he said: “I have only one master and that too for my whole life." He was also felicitated by Maharaja Sayajirao of Baroda. When Shree Hari left this world, Bhaguji served Ayodhaprasadji Maharaj. Then, he left for Muli Mandir where he served until his last breath.
> #### Moral: ###
> Learn to serve Shreeji Maharaj selflessly and strive to become as dedicated as Bhaguji

### Shuk Muni's Faith
Shukanand Swami composed poems in Sanskrit. Once, he decided to please Maharaj by composing some poems. He wrote the poems and showed them to Maharaj. As soon as Maharaj took those poems in his hands, he threw them in water. Other poets would feel insulted by Maharaja’s act, but Shuk Muni was not offended. He then wrote other poems. Maharaj threw them into water without even reading them. This continued for some time.

Maharaj asked him, “Don’t you feel I am unappreciative?” Shuk Muni replied, “Not the least Maharaj. I was writing poems only to please you. You took pleasure in throwing all my poems into water. Your pleasure was my pleasure. My pleasure consisted of your pleasure, hence why should I feel insulted?”

Hence, Shreeji Maharaj was very pleased with Shuk Muni. Shuk Muni belonged to the village of Dabhan so Maharaj very fondly called him `Dabhanio Sadhu'. Maharaj used to say, “This Dabhanio sadhu is very useful to me.” Whoever finds pleasure in the pleasure of Shriji Maharaj is a very useful person.

> ### Moral ### 
> A poet loves his poems as parents love their children, thus if anyone
> neglects their poem, the poet feels offended. Although Shuk Muni was a
> poet, he considered Maharaj’s wishes as his own. That’s why even
> though Maharaj neglected the poems, Shuk Muni never felt insulted.
> This is called true devotion.

### Fragrance of Sandalwood
Vadtal Mandir was under construction. One day, Shreeji Maharaj visited the site. All the saints and devotees were working very hard. The work was strenuous and involved tasks like grinding lime and carrying bricks. Those engaged in this laborious work were covered in dirt and mud. Maharaj was highly pleased to see their efforts, and he said, “Come on, let us embrace.”

The saints and devotees replied, “Maharaj, our bodies are dirty and muddy.”

Maharaj responded merrily, “Who says your bodies are muddy? It is not mud; it is the fragrance of sandalwood!”

Saying this, Shreeji Maharaj embraced each of them, one by one. Such was Shreeji Maharaj—he toiled alongside others, made them work, and honored those who labored.

> ### Moral ### 
> We should strive to do seva selflessly to please Shreeji Maharaj

### Fisherman and the fish
Once, Ghanshyam Maharaj was playing with His friends Pragh, Madhav, and Veniram by the banks of a lake near Chhapaiya. They saw a fisherman in a boat, fishing. When they noticed the fish dying outside the water in baskets, Ghanshyam Maharaj became very upset. He swam up to the boat, gave life back to the fish, and returned them to the lake.

The fisherman saw this and became very angry. He started shouting at Maharaj. In response, Ghanshyam Maharaj transformed into the image of Yamraj and showed the fisherman the consequences of his actions. He revealed to the fisherman the suffering he would endure in hell for his sin.

Frightened, the fisherman pleaded with Maharaj, explaining that he was only doing this for his livelihood. Maharaj replied that there are many ways to earn a living that do not involve violence. The fisherman then promised not to kill any more fish. Ghanshyam Maharaj blessed him and redeemed him of his sins.

> ### Moral ### 
> We should always practice non-violence as it is the highest dharma

### 900,000 Blessings
The Navlakh Mountains were home to 900,000 Siddhas, all engaged in intense tapasya (penance). Each Siddha had their own designated place for penance, surrounded by lush green grass and a landscape enriched with both hot and cold springs. Giving blessings to such a vast number of Siddhas would seem impossible for most, but Nilkanth Varni manifested 900,000 images of Himself to bless them all simultaneously.

Nilkanth Varni then approached the leader of the Siddhas and inquired about the purpose of their tapascharya . The Siddha responded, “We perform tapasya to attain immortality.” Hearing this, Nilkanth Varni remarked, “I thought you were wise beings, yet you value your physical body more than your soul. The body is merely a temporary prison for the soul during its time on Earth. Instead, you should be performing tapasya to please Bhagwan and purify your soul, so it may be freed from this prison and attain eternal bliss in Akshardham.”

Realizing their mistake, the Siddhas sought guidance from Nilkanth Varni to show them the true path.

> ### Moral ### 
> We should identify ourselves as the atma (soul) whenever we do bhakti
