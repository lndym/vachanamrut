# Gems from the Vachanamrut 


Furthermore, Purushottam Bhagwan is the inspirer of both the ãtmã and Akshar, is independent from them, and is their controller; He possesses all spiritual powers; He is greater than even Akshar, which is greater than everything. Out of compassion, that Purushottam Bhagwan appears as a human being on this Earth, for the kalyãn of jeevs. Understanding Him to eternally possess a divya swarup, a person who offers bhakti and upãsanã to Him acquires qualities similar to those of Bhagwan, as well as countless other spiritual powers.

For example, when an extremely sharp arrow pierces and lodges into its target, it cannot be removed. However, if that same arrow, with its tip removed so that only its shaft remains, were to be shot at a wall, it would rebound and fall to the ground; it would not penetrate the wall like the sharp-tipped arrow. Similarly, when the jagged edges of the manomay chakra, i.e., the indriya, are worn away, then no matter how alluring the vishays may be, the indriyas vruttis would not be drawn towards them. Instead, they would rebound like the blunt arrow-shaft. When one is able to behave in this manner, the jagged edges of the manomay chakra can be said to have been worn away.”

Bhagwan is pleased with a devotee who worships Him after becoming free from lust, anger, avarice, deceit, false sense of respect, envy, and pride.

There is no sinner worse than the person who does not realise Bhagwan to be the all-doer. In fact, he should be known to be a sinner worse than a person who has killed a cow, killed a brãhmin, associated with the wife of one's own guru, or maligned a sadguru who is a knower of brahm. This is because he believes Kãl, karma, etc., to be the cause of everything; not Bhagwan. In fact, one should not even stand in the shadow of such persons who are nãstik outcasts, nor should one listen to their talks, even unknowingly.

Shreeji Mahãrãj replied, “Bhagwan always resides in His Akshardhãm. From the countless Pradhãn-Purush pairs that evolve from Mul-Mãyã, countless millions of brahmãnds evolve. Then, for the sake of His bhaktas, while still residing at one location in His Akshardhãm, and by His own wish, that Bhagwan appears in countless rups in the countless millions of brahmãnds.”

It is appropriate to have mãn (pride) before a person who spites satsang or speaks derogatorily of Bhagwan or His great sant. If a person does speak derogatorily, one should retaliate with words as sharp as an arrow; but in no way should one become humble before a vimukh. On the other hand, it is not appropriate to have mãn before Bhagwan or His sant. Before them, putting mãn aside, behaving as a dãs of a dãs, and becoming nirmanpanu (without pride), is the only appropriate behaviour.

*Panchala 5*

One who does side with a vimukh, will himself definitely become a vimukh as well, either in this life or in the next. Therefore, a bhakta of Bhagvãn should certainly side with Bhagvãn’s bhaktas and abandon the side of vimukhs. Please firmly remember this discourse of mine.

How is that Bhagwan? He is above both the mutable and the immutable. He is the cause of all causes and is immutable. His lotus-like feet are served by innumerable redeemed muktas. Such merciful Bhagwan is present before your very eyes now, manifested for doing the ultimate good to all beings.

*Gadhada Antya 31*

Moreover, Brahmã, Shiv, Laxmiji, Radhaji, Nãrad, Shukji, the Sanakãdik, the nine Yogeshwars, and such other great ones apply the dust of Bhagwan’s lotus-like feet upon their heads. They keep away false sense of honor and constantly offer bhakti to Bhagwan
